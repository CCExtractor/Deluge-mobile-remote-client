## Usage

In order to use this flutter application you should have Deluge configured on your system, after which you can connect your mobile on the same network as your system and use the app by entering the configuration (IP address).

If you find any difficulty in running Deluge on your system, you can use this [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/deluge).

***Note: The primary usage of this application is to control Deluge hosted on your seedbox account.***

## Seedbox

A seedbox is a dedicated BitTorrent server. Often they are rented out by companies called seedbox providers.

Seedboxes usually have a high speed Internet connection. This allows users to download torrents quickly and seed the torrents for a long time.

You can learn more about seedbox [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox).
